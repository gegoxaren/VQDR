fast_number.vala:
            Use decimal point values without having to do floating point
            maths. It uses normal Integer (long) values to store all the
            information about the numbers, and thus skips the advanced maths
            needed for Floating point values. Useful for divices without an
            FPU or where the FPU is slow.
