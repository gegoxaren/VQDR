                       Vala/Very Quick Dice Roller

To see README about libvqdr, please see ./src/libvqdr/README

VQDR will consist of two parts, the backend library, and the front end.

The backend libray, libvqdr, provides the logic for parsing dice expression
strings, and doing the calculations needed to perform the dice rolls.

The frontend has yet to be written.
